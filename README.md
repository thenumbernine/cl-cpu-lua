I haven't had the best of luck with the CPU OpenCL implementation of Intel OpenCL.
I guess AMD's CPU OpenCL is dead.
So for now I'll make a LuaJIT version.
I'm making it in LuaJIT so that I can easily do string manipulation and invoke the gcc compiler.
Maybe later I'll make a C++ version.

Depends on my libraries:
	lua-ext
	lua-template
	lua-ffi-c
